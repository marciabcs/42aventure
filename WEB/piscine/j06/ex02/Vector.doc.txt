<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is document instruction to class Vector

In this class you enter two Vertex points one for origin and another for
destination of the vector. The sintax is like that:

new Vector (array('origin' => $VertexOrign, 'dest' => $VertexDest));

if origin is not set, the point x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 and w = 1 is set as
default.

This Class proposes different methods to calculations with vectors
they are: float magnitude as magnitude() , vector normalization as 
normalize() , vector addition as add(Vector $rhs), vector substraction
as sub(Vector $rhs), vector opposite as opposite(), scalar product as 
 scalarProduct( $k ), float dot product as  dotProduct( Vector $rhs ),
 cosinus of the angle two vectors as  cos( Vector $rhs ) and vector 
 cross product crossProduct( Vector $rhs ).
 
 I hope you can work with your vectors. Enjoy this class!!
